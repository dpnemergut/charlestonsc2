				Welcome to the home of Starcraft tournaments in Charleston, South Carolina!
				Every now and then we play a tournament together online and meet up afterwards for drinks and food.
				Feel free to register for the tournament and include your information as well as your bar suggestion to meet up at afterwards.
				You'll be updated with the tournament information when we come closer to the event.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				FIRST TOURNAMENT UPDATE: Our first tournament will be on Sunday, March 3rd beginning at 11 AM.
				We will meet on the channel "CharlestonSC2" in battle.net and it will be opened an hour before the matches start.
				The bracket will be posted an hour before the tournament to leave players time to see who their first opponents are.
